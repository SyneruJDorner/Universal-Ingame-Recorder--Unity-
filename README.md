# Universal-Ingame-Recorder--Unity- <br />
A simple game/editor recorder for unity using FFMPEG. <br />
 <br />
**Requires:** <br />
-Unity 2019+ <br />
-CUDA (currently it needs a nvidia card with CUDA) <br />
 <br />
**How To Use:** <br />
-Download the project and add it to your unity project. <br />
-Attach the script 'IngameVideoRecorder' to a GameObject. <br />
-For now press F10 to start and stop recording, a log will tell you the state of the recording. <br />
 <br />
**What are my plans with this:** <br />
-Have it work on Windows, Mac and Linux. <br />
-Have it work with AMD cards, and cards without cuda support. <br />
-Have it work on the CPU if there is no GPU. <br />
-Have it save multiple videos, right now it overwrite your video.

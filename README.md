# Universal-Ingame-Recorder--Unity-__
A simple game/editor recorder for unity using FFMPEG.__

**Requires:**__
-Unity 2019+__
-CUDA (currently it needs a nvidia card with CUDA)__

**How To Use:**__
-Download the project and add it to your unity project.__
-Attach the script 'IngameVideoRecorder' to a GameObject.__
-For now press F10 to start and stop recording, a log will tell you the state of the recording.__

**What are my plans with this:**__
-Have it work on Windows, Mac and Linux.__
-Have it work with AMD cards, and cards without cuda support.__
-Have it work on the CPU if there is no GPU.__
-Have it save multiple videos, right now it overwrite your video.__

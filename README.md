# Universal-Ingame-Recorder--Unity-
A simple game/editor recorder for unity using FFMPEG.

**Requires:**
-Unity 2019+
-CUDA (currently it needs a nvidia card with CUDA)

**How To Use:**
-Download the project and add it to your unity project.
-Attach the script 'IngameVideoRecorder' to a GameObject.
-For now press F10 to start and stop recording, a log will tell you the state of the recording.

**What are my plans with this:**
-Have it work on Windows, Mac and Linux.
-Have it work with AMD cards, and cards without cuda support.
-Have it work on the CPU if there is no GPU.
-Have it save multiple videos, right now it overwrite your video.
